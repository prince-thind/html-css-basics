# Remarks

git history of this repository might actually seem strange to careful git log observers. This is actually due to my obsession with preserving old commits and using git rebase everywhere. Sometime in the past, all branches of this repository used to exist as independent repositories. All those previous repositories were fetched into this repository as branches and then carefully merged to create the state of the repository you see now. The old repositories were deleted.
